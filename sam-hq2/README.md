# HQ-SAM 2: Segment Anything in High Quality for Images and Videos    


We propose **HQ-SAM2** to upgrade SAM2 to **higher quality** by extending our training strategy in [HQ-SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01567). 

## Latest updates

**2024/11/17 -- HQ-SAM 2 is released**

- A new suite of improved model checkpoints (denoted as **HQ-SAM 2**, **beta-version**) are released. See [Model Description](#model-description) for details.

## Installation

HQ-SAM 2 needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq.git
conda create -n sam_hq2 python=3.10 -y
conda activate sam_hq2
cd sam-hq/sam-hq2
pip install -e .
```
If you are installing on Windows, it's strongly recommended to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Ubuntu.

To use the HQ-SAM 2 predictor and run the example notebooks, `jupyter` and `matplotlib` are required and can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

Note:
1. It's recommended to create a new Python environment via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for this installation and install PyTorch 2.3.1 (or higher) via `pip` following https://pytorch.org/. If you have a PyTorch version lower than 2.3.1 in your current environment, the installation command above will try to upgrade it to the latest PyTorch version using `pip`.
2. The step above requires compiling a custom CUDA kernel with the `nvcc` compiler. If it isn't already available on your machine, please install the [CUDA toolkits](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) with a version that matches your PyTorch CUDA version.
3. If you see a message like `Failed to build the SAM 2 CUDA extension` during installation, you can ignore it and still use SAM 2 (some post-processing functionality may be limited, but it doesn't affect the results in most cases).

Please see [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for FAQs on potential issues and solutions.

## Getting Started

### Download Checkpoints

First, we need to download a model checkpoint. All the model checkpoints can be downloaded by running:

```bash
cd checkpoints && \
./download_ckpts.sh && \
cd ..
```

or individually from:

<!-- - [sam2.1_hiera_large.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/092824/sam2.1_hiera_large.pt) -->
- [sam2.1_hq_hiera_large.pt](https://huggingface.co/lkeab/hq-sam/resolve/main/sam2.1_hq_hiera_large.pt?download=true)

(note that these are the improved checkpoints denoted as SAM 2.1; see [Model Description](#model-description) for details.)

Then HQ-SAM 2 can be used in a few lines as follows for image and video prediction.

### Image prediction

HQ-SAM 2 has all the capabilities of [HQ-SAM](https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq) on static images, and we provide image prediction APIs that closely resemble SAM for image use cases. The `SAM2ImagePredictor` class has an easy interface for image prompting.

```python
import torch
from sam2.build_sam import build_sam2
from sam2.sam2_image_predictor import SAM2ImagePredictor
# Baseline SAM2.1
# checkpoint = "./checkpoints/sam2.1_hiera_large.pt"
# model_cfg = "configs/sam2.1/sam2.1_hiera_l.yaml"

# Ours HQ-SAM 2
checkpoint = "./checkpoints/sam2.1_hq_hiera_large.pt"
model_cfg = "configs/sam2.1/sam2.1_hq_hiera_l.yaml"
predictor = SAM2ImagePredictor(build_sam2(model_cfg, checkpoint))

with torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast("cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
    masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>, multimask_output=False)
```

Please refer to the examples in [python demo/demo_hqsam2.py](./demo/demo_hqsam2.py) for details on how to add click or box prompts.

Please refer to the examples in [image_predictor_example.ipynb](./notebooks/image_predictor_example.ipynb) for static image use cases.

### Video prediction

For promptable segmentation and tracking in videos, we provide a video predictor with APIs for example to add prompts and propagate masklets throughout a video. SAM 2 supports video inference on multiple objects and uses an inference state to keep track of the interactions in each video.

```python
import torch
from sam2.build_sam import build_sam2_video_predictor
from sam2.build_sam import build_sam2_hq_video_predictor
# Baseline SAM2.1
# checkpoint = "./checkpoints/sam2.1_hiera_large.pt"
# model_cfg = "configs/sam2.1/sam2.1_hiera_l.yaml"
# predictor = build_sam2_video_predictor(model_cfg, checkpoint)

# Ours HQ-SAM 2
checkpoint = "./checkpoints/sam2.1_hq_hiera_large.pt"
model_cfg = "configs/sam2.1/sam2.1_hq_hiera_l.yaml"
predictor = build_sam2_hq_video_predictor(model_cfg, checkpoint)

with torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast("cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    state = predictor.init_state(<your_video>)

    # add new prompts and instantly get the output on the same frame
    frame_idx, object_ids, masks = predictor.add_new_points_or_box(state, <your_prompts>):

    # propagate the prompts to get masklets throughout the video
    for frame_idx, object_ids, masks in predictor.propagate_in_video(state):
        ...
```


Please refer to the examples in [video_predictor_example.ipynb](./notebooks/video_predictor_example.ipynb) for static image use cases.
